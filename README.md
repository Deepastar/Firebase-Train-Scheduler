Train Scheduler

In this project i need to write a code for scheduling train and time using firebase database
Then add a train name, destination, frequency, next arrival and minutes away into as a column
For this i just created html, css and js file.
Then i created html layout by creating table as rows and columns
 Then i used firebase setup
 And used jquery codes and moment.js for math operation.
 Finally appending a new row to add new train schedule.
